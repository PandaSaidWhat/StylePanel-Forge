# StylePanel
### Structured Prompt Architecture for Forge  
#### Powered by UCP (Universe Control Panel)

StylePanel is a workflow-centric extension for **Forge (Neo)** that introduces structured, repeatable prompt composition through a controlled injection architecture called **UCP**.

Designed for:

- Stable Diffusion 1.x  
- SDXL  
- Flux  

StylePanel is not a tag list.

It is a prompt control layer.

## 🚀 Why StylePanel Exists

Prompting without structure eventually becomes inconsistent.

StylePanel enforces clarity without limiting creativity.

It provides:

- Structured visual components  
- Reduced repetition  
- Controlled injection behavior  
- Reproducible generation workflows  

UCP (Universe Control Panel) is the engine that governs how style components move into Forge’s generation pipeline.

## ⚙️ UCP Mode Configuration

UCP execution mode is configured globally in the Forge Settings panel.

Upon first installation, StylePanel defaults to:

**Manual Mode (Inject Only)**

Only the **Inject** button is available by default.

To enable other modes, navigate to:

Forge → Settings → StylePanel (UCP Mode)

Available options:

- Manual (Inject Only)
- Semi-Automatic (Editable)
- Automatic (Locked)

The selected mode persists across sessions.

## 🧠 UCP Modes (Behavior)

Once configured, UCP controls how style components are injected into the generation pipeline.

### 1️⃣ Manual — Inject Only

- Styles populate locked preview fields  
- You must click **Inject** to transfer tags into the prompt  
- No automatic generation occurs  
- Safest and most controlled workflow  

---

### 2️⃣ Semi-Automatic — Editable Preview

- Preview fields become editable  
- **Inject** becomes **Generate (UCP Mode)**  
- Preview + prompt merge before generation  
- Ideal for hybrid workflows and live tweaking  

---

### 3️⃣ Automatic — Locked Pipeline

- Injection happens automatically  
- Preview fields are locked  
- Generation executes immediately  
- Designed for automation and consistent output workflows

## 🔥 New Feature: Pro-Weighting Shortcuts
When using **Semi-Automatic Mode**, you can use industry-standard keyboard shortcuts directly within the **Positive Preview** box:

- **CTRL + Arrow Up**: Increase weight of selected text by 0.1.
- **CTRL + Arrow Down**: Decrease weight of selected text by 0.1.
- **Smart Cleanup**: Parentheses and weights are automatically removed if the value reaches 1.0, keeping your prompts clean.

## 🔥 Flux Compatibility Note

Negative prompt injection is intentionally disabled in **Flux mode**, as Forge does not utilize negative prompts with Flux models.
